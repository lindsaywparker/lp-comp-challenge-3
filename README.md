# Lindsay's Static Comp 3
## Project Overview
This version of Static Comp 3 is built from the mobile size up primarily with `display: flex`.  At mobile size, the sidebar navigation links are hidden, the tab titles are collapsed into a dropdown, and the content is all centered.

The media query at 565px expands the tab titles into a partial version with 'More...' displayed.

At 950px, the full sidebar menu is displayed, the top search bar becomes its full height, and all tab names are displayed.  The main content is still displayed in a column until the window width can support the charts side-by-side at 1200px.
